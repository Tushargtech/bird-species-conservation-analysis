# 🐦 Bird Species Observation & Conservation Analysis

A complete biodiversity monitoring and conservation analysis project using Python, Power BI, and Streamlit based on bird species data from forest and grassland ecosystems.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze bird species distribution, biodiversity, and conservation hotspots to support strategic environmental planning, eco-tourism, and policy formulation.

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights (Power BI)

| KPI | Insight |
|-----|---------|
| **Total Species Observed** | Biodiversity distribution across ecosystems |
| **Top 10 Species** | Dominant species per region |
| **Observation Trends** | Annual growth/decline in observations |
| **Ecosystem Comparison** | Forest vs Grassland patterns |
| **Threatened Species Map** | Regional hotspots needing conservation |

🔍 Filters & slicers: Region, Year, Ecosystem, Species Type, Threat Level

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Forests show **higher species diversity**, while grasslands have **frequent sightings of a few dominant species**.
- **Biodiversity hotspots** are geographically concentrated and crucial for targeted conservation.
- A few bird species span both ecosystems, indicating potential cross-ecosystem importance.
- Signs of **species decline** were noted in regions with urban expansion.
